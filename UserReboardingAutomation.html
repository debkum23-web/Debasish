        <h3 class="section-title">Context</h3>
        <p>When employees re-joined the company, they encountered access issues with SharePoint sites and files that had been previously shared with them during their earlier tenure. Their old account traces remained in the system, creating permission conflicts.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Problem</h3>
        <p>Re-joining employees had to raise helpdesk tickets and wait days for resolution. The manual two-step process required: (1) IT support to manually identify and remove old account traces from sites, and (2) contacting site owners to re-share access. This time-consuming, multi-handoff workflow delayed productivity and created frustration for re-joiners, helpdesk teams, and site owners alike.</p>

        <h3 class="section-title">Goal</h3>
        <p>Transform the days-long manual process into a minutes-long automated workflow. Eliminate helpdesk dependency for step 1 (cleanup), streamline step 2 (re-sharing requests), reduce support burden, and ensure re-joining employees have rapid access to their required resources.</p>

        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong>User Research:</strong> Shadowed helpdesk operations during manual cleanup, observed the multi-day wait cycles, and documented handoff delays between IT and site owners</li>
          <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Quantified the problem using ticket metrics: average 3-5 day resolution time, peak volumes during re-hiring seasons, and cost per manual intervention</li>
          <li><strong>Requirements Gathering:</strong> Documented edge cases like partial access, guest users, and external sharing through collaborative workshops with IT and site owners</li>
          <li><strong>Prioritization:</strong> Used value vs. effort matrix to sequence features: Step 1 (automated cleanup) delivered immediate value, Step 2 (streamlined re-sharing) added convenience, notifications provided transparency</li>

      <h3 class="section-title">Key Takeaways</h3>
      <article class="card">
        <p>This project exemplifies product ownership at its core: using data to quantify a critical pain point (3-5 day wait times), building multi-stakeholder consensus across IT, site owners, and HR, and delivering incremental value through phased automation. By transforming a manual, multi-day process into a minutes-long automated workflow, we not only reduced operational costs but also dramatically improved the re-joiner experience during a critical moment. The data-driven, iterative approach allowed us to prove value quickly (Step 1 automation), then expand based on measured impact rather than assumptions (Step 2 enhancement), ultimately creating a business case for broader HR integration.</p>
